# Simple-gambling-game-python
I made this python written game
In the game you start with 100 currency, you then have to choose a color: black or red.
If the color is correct, you win the amount you bet.
If the color is wrong, you lose the amount you bet, It is really simple.
I added some sound effects to experiment
